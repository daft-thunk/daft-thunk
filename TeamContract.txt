# Daily process
Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
	Slack big Pat for this meeting
	New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
	Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
	keep it relevant
	update us on how you feel
Pair program on assigned tasks when appropriate
Re-group meeting right after lunch: 1:30
	Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss.
	At 1:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
	check with group members
	call in more people as needed. gather research etc before
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other's code and merge into master
	dont push up non-working code (tbd)
	don't merge your own PR if possible

# Team expectations
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
	Delegate pair tasks earlier in the day if possible.
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another's train of coding-thought
	If no one responds, we're cool with getting bothered.
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
	Initial setup: pair front end vs back end

Style Guide:
	React: .js (not .jsx)
		capitalize component file names
	Semantic UI
	SEMICOLONS!!!

WRITE TESTS!!!
	Single /tests folder (broken out)
	*.spec.js

None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on

# Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
	Take 10-15 minute break
	List out the pros / cons
	Vote on it (tiebreaker)
	If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
	Take a walk or get some water
	Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
